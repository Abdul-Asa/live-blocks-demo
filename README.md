# Liveblocks Next.js Demo

## Overview

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little playground where I've been tinkering with Liveblocks to get the hang of how it works. This project is a real-time collaborative experience using Next.js and liveblocks tools. It's a simple demo, but pretty neat for getting a feel of Liveblocks.

I've got another similar demo but this time with Supabase Realtime [here](https://realtime-tutorial.vercel.app/) . This one has less functionality has supabase realtime has less features than liveblocks

## Features

- **Multiplayer Cursors**: Real-time tracking and display of multiple users' cursor positions.
- **Chat**: An interactive chat interface where users can communicate and share their thoughts.
- **Emoji Reactions**: Users can express their reactions using a variety of emojis.
